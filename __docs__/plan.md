1. justed.in -> our landing page (this will be on different server) - smaller computer is fine for this

2. app.justed.in -> the landing page of our dashboard - our main LMS. (this will be on a medium to large server)

3. Once user signs up, (s)he creates the organization in the onboarding process. <- app.justed.in/onboarding

4. Once onboarded, the user is redirected to <- app.justed.in/org/{org_name}. For the first time, you login, you will be asked to verify the admin email. The email provided can create multiple organizations. (By default adding organization is disabled). 

5. Once verified, you are redirected to the org page <- app.justed.in/org/{org_name}. Once a modal will appear saying Thank you and introducing who we are. 

6. app.justed.in/org/orgtesting/settings?tab=landingpage -> Here you control the data that you see on the organization landing page: {org_name}.justed.in. 

7. Now when you login from here i.e. {org_name}.justed.in/login -> you login as a student/learner to that organization. 

8. Once logged in as student on {org_name}.justed.in/login, you shall be redirected to the student LMS: {org_name}.justed.in/lms. We can make student join the organization by sending them an invite link as well.
